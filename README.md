# CodeXGLUE - Code Search (WebQueryTest)

The modified project for testing the relevance of the source code and natural language description 
from [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE) competition.
The original code is available in a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Text-Code/NL-code-search-WebQuery). 

## Prerequisites

### Running with Docker

* [Task](https://taskfile.dev) (tested with v3.15.2)
* Docker 20.10 (tested with 20.10.19) with Compose and BuildKit installed
  * Compose and BuildKit are included by default in the latest versions of Docker

### Running locally

* Linux or Windows machine with WSL
  * Not tested on macOS
* Python 3.7
  * [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) can be used to install legacy versions of Python
* [Task](https://taskfile.dev) (tested with v3.15.2)
* (Optional) CUDA toolkit and Nvidia graphics card/accelerator
  * In case no CUDA acceleration is available, PyTorch will default to CPU

## Launching the learning pipeline

### With Docker

Make sure that the Docker daemon is running and build the Docker image with:
```bash
task docker:build
```
This step has to be re-executed whenever changes are made to the source code.

Start the container with:
```bash
task docker:up
```
It will sleep in the background and wait for the commands to be executed with `docker:exec`,
so that its local data are available for extraction with `docker:extract`.
Wxecute arbitrary task by passing its name after `--`:
```bash
# Without access to GPU
task docker:exec -- task code:train
# With access to GPU
task docker:exec-gpu -- task code:train
```

To display the tasks relevant to the training, execute the following:
```bash
task docker:exec-gpu -- task -l
```

To execute the `code:train` production training task, execute the following:
```bash
task docker:exec -- code:train
```

#### Executing commands manually from within the container

In order to enter the container's shell and execute commands, run the following:
```bash
# Without access to GPU
task docker:run -- bash
# With access to GPU
task docker:run-gpu -- bash
```

#### Copying data from within the container

The data in the container are not persisted when the container is rebuilt.
In order to extract it from the container, use the `docker:extract` task.
For example, to extract the trained production models after running `task docker:train`

```bash
task docker:extract -- model_codesearchnet
task docker:extract -- model_cosqa_continue_training
```

#### Stopping and removing the container

To stop the container without removing data, execute the following:
```bash
task docker:stop
```

To remove the container and all its data (like the trained models), execute the following:
```bash
task docker:down
```

### Without Docker

Ensure that you are running Python 3.7 (check with `python -V`).

To display the tasks relevant to the training, execute the following:
```bash
task -l
```

To display all the tasks (including intermediate ones, like data processing or virtual environment creation), execute the following:
```bash
task --list-all
```

For instance, to run the production training pipeline, call: 
```bash
task code:train
```

The virtual environment will be created automatically.
The dataset will also be downloaded and preprocessed.

## Dataset

We are using the CoSQA dataset, available in the repository, as well as the CodeSearchNet dataset,
which can be downloaded from either:
* executing task `task data:download-model`
* directly: https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-search-net/CodeSearchNet/v2/python.zip

# Original README

**Update 2021.07.30:** We add CoSQA into CodeXGLUE, and recommend you to use this dataset as the training and development set of CodeXGLUE -- Code Search (WebQueryTest) Challenge. The dataset can be found in `./cosqa`. For more details about the dataset collection and usage, please refer to the [ACL 2021 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13239) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Jun-jie-Huang/CoCLR). 

## Task Description

Code Search is aimed to find a code snippet which best matches the demand of the query. This task can be formulated in two scenarios: retrieval scenario and text-code classification scenario. In WebQueryTest , we present the Code Search in text-code classification scenario.

In WebQueryTest, a trained model needs to judge whether a code snippet answers a given natural language query, which can be formulated into a binary classification problem. 

Most  existing  code search datasets use code documentations or questions from online communities for software developers as queries, which is still different from real user search queries.  Therefore we provide WebQueryTest testing set.

## Dependency

- python 3.6 or 3.7
- torch==1.5.0
- transformers>=2.5.0


## Data

Here we present WebQueryTest dataset,  a  testing  set  of  Python code  search of 1,046  query-code pairs with code search intent and their human annotations. The realworld user queries are collected from Bing query logs and the code for queries are from CodeSearchNet. You can find our testing set in `./data/test_webquery.json` .

Since there's no direct training set for our WebQueryTest dataset, we suggest using two external training sets: 1. CodeSearchNet; 2. CoSQA.

1. To finetune the models on CodeSearchNet, we provide scripts to obtain the documentation-function pairs in the training set o CodeSearchNet AdvTest as positive instances. For each documentation, we also randomly sample 7 more functions to form negative instances. The following command is used to download and preprocess the data:

```shell
cd data
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-search-net/CodeSearchNet/v2/python.zip
unzip python.zip
python preprocess.py
rm -r python
rm -r *.pkl
rm python.zip
cd ..
```

2. You can also continue finetuning the model on CoSQA dataset. CoSQA includes 20,604 labels for pairs of natural language queries and Python codes, with almost the same collections and data format as the 1,046 pairs in WebQueryTest. You can find the CoSQA training and dev set in `./data/cosqa_train.json` and   `./data/cosqa_dev.json` . The detailed construction of CoSQA can be found in the paper [CoSQA: 20,000+ Web Queries for Code Search and Question Answering (In Proceedings of ACL 2021)]().

#### Data statistics

Data statistics of WebQueryTest are shown in the table below:

|              | #Examples |
| :----------: | :-------: |
| WebQueryTest |   1,046   |

Data statistics of CoSQA are shown in the table below:

|                | #Examples |
| :------------: | :-------: |
| CoSQA-training |  20,000   |
|   CoSQA-dev    |    604    |

## Fine-tuning

You can use the following command to finetune the model on CodeSearchNet:

```shell
python code/run_classifier.py \
			--model_type roberta \
			--do_train \
			--do_eval \
			--eval_all_checkpoints \
			--train_file train_codesearchnet_7.json \
			--dev_file dev_codesearchnet.json \
			--max_seq_length 200 \
			--per_gpu_train_batch_size 16 \
			--per_gpu_eval_batch_size 16 \
			--learning_rate 1e-5 \
			--num_train_epochs 3 \
			--gradient_accumulation_steps 1 \
			--warmup_steps 1000 \
			--evaluate_during_training \
			--data_dir ./data/ \
			--output_dir ./model_codesearchnet \
			--encoder_name_or_path microsoft/codebert-base 
```

You can then use the following command to continue finetuning the model on CoSQA:

```shell
python code/run_classifier.py \
			--model_type roberta \
			--do_train \
			--do_eval \
			--eval_all_checkpoints \
			--train_file cosqa_train.json \
			--dev_file cosqa_dev.json \
			--max_seq_length 200 \
			--per_gpu_train_batch_size 16 \
			--per_gpu_eval_batch_size 16 \
			--learning_rate 1e-5 \
			--num_train_epochs 3 \
			--gradient_accumulation_steps 1 \
			--warmup_steps 5000 \
			--evaluate_during_training \
			--data_dir ./data/ \
			--output_dir ./model_cosqa_continue_training \
			--encoder_name_or_path ./model_codesearchnet 

```

## Evaluation

To test on the WebQueryTest, you run the following command. Also it will automatically generate predictions to `--prediction_file`.

```shell
python code/run_classifier.py \
			--model_type roberta \
			--do_predict \
			--test_file test_webquery.json \
			--max_seq_length 200 \
			--per_gpu_eval_batch_size 2 \
			--data_dir ./data \
			--output_dir ./model_cosqa_continue_training/checkpoint-best-aver/ \
			--encoder_name_or_path microsoft/codebert-base \
			--pred_model_dir ./model_cosqa_continue_training/checkpoint-last/ \
			--prediction_file ./evaluator/webquery_predictions.txt 
			
```

After generate predictions for WebQueryTest, you can use our provided script to evaluate:

```shell
python evaluator/evaluator.py \
		--answers_webquery ./evaluator/webquery_answers.txt \
		--predictions_webquery evaluator/webquery_predictions.txt
```
